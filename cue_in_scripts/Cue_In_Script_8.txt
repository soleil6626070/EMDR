"With your eyes closed or a soft gaze in front of you, take a deep breath, and remember the screen in front of you. You hear the sound of drilling downstairs. You notice the smell of wood around you. Feel the pain in your knees. Notice the tension in your feet. Allow yourself to be present in this moment as we begin the EMDR processing."
